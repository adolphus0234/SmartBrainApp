App To-Do List:

-ADD state for error handling (in case API fails) => can trigger error message

-add placeholder inside input field to replace 'enter image url'

-**STRENGTHEN SECURITY**

onSubmit => triggers a function with a timeout for x amount of time
			-if response does not happen in x amount of time, a state change will occur
			>this state change will be used in a conditional statement, which will render
			an error message

			-if response does happen, a clearTimeout command will occur
			>this will prevent the state change from occuring, which will not trigger the 
			event that renders an error message


			create functions in constructor area:
					-one that sets timeout before trigger state
					-one that clears timeout of above function
